### This is where i will be jotting down Git basics stuff
### git status will display whether git is keeping track of your files

### git init will make that folder a git repository by making a hidden 
# .git file in that folder

### git status and the files are red in color just means that they are 
# not being tracked by git as files in the repository 

### git add will make the files tracked thus adding it to the repository 
# it also helps to track changes made to a file that has been added and 
# committed before to the git repository after which we can then commit 
# those changes

### git commit -m "commit numbr or a id" this will save the changes we 
# made for this version so next time we modify and commit we get a 
# different version and stuff saved with the previous saved commit still 
# available
